A Service layer is meant to handle any business logic your application has. This is things like
data validation, credentials authentication, ensuring user input is in a valid format, etc.

Data is provided by the Controller layer (the API layer) and then the Service layer performs any
checks or transformations necesssary before the data interacts with the back-end database.

Sometimes the Service layer will not be able to perform its functions until data is returned from the database
(think about login credentials: you need to get potential matches from the database before a determination can be made
about whether the credentials are legit or not).

This means the Service layer is also responsible for sending data into the Repository layer where database interactions
happen.
