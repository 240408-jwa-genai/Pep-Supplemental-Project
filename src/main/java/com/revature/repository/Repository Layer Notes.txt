The Repository Layer is where interactions with your back-end database happen. Data from
the service layer is used to make queries to the database, and any result sets returned from
the database are formatted into a data type that your application can understand, and the data
is returned to the Service layer either for further validation or so the Service Layer can
send the data to the Controller Layer (the API).
