The Controller layer of an application (sometimes called the API) is where users initially
interact with your application. The role of the controller is to take user input and convert
it into meaningful data for the application. 

In this three tier setup, the controller will convert the incoming data into a format that is
useable by the application and then it will pass it into the Service layer so that data
validation can be performed on the user-provided data.

Once the data has been dealt with, one way or another, the Controller layer finishes its work
by taking any necessary return data, transforming it into end-user meaningful data, and sending
it back to them.
